PHP Security Bundle
=========================

These libaries are a recommended bundle of tools that can be used to protect your application from common attacks:

- Psecio/Parse for source code static scanning
- Aura/Session for session management
- Psecio/Gatekeeper for user management, authorization and authentication
- Gregwar/CAPTCHA for CAPTCHA generation
- Kunsttube/CSRFP for CSRF form protection
- Ircmaxell/Randomlib for random string and token generation

Not included but also recommended:

- [password_compat](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat) if you don't have the `password_hash` functionality
